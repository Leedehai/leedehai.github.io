    The timing and nature of reported alternative investment returns also
    pose challenges to monitoring the performance of alternative investment
    managers. For call-down strategies such as private equity, private real
    estate, and real assets, tracking and calculating performance might require
    different systems and methodologies. Private equity, credit, and real
    estate returns are typically reported using internal rates of return (IRRs)
    rather than time-weighted returns (TWR) as is common in the liquid asset
    classes. IRRs are sensitive to the timing of cash flows into and out of the
    fund. Two managers may have similar portfolios but very different return
    profiles depending on their particular capital call and distribution
    schedule. Investors have to be wise to the ways in which a manager can bias
    their reported IRR. Alternative metrics, such as multiple on invested
    capital (MOIC) have been developed to provide an additional frame of
    reference.
